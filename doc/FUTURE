pcap generation
---------------

NFS support:

  Maybe add NFS support via hacking up www.citi.umich.edu/projects/nfsv4/pynfs/ 
  If NFS4 is encrypted, examine NFS3 if possible. Add both if not an issue.

SMB support:

  Can hack up dionera's SMB python module to provide smb file open / read and
  writes etc.

  With that, we could have SMB pcap generation support, which will be good.

File encoding:

  Support different encoding options (maybe look at non standard gzip + base64
  for email protocols, etc).

TFTP support:

  looks like it would be easy to use to http://sourceforge.net/projects/tftpy/
  to implement the tftp protocol. much use? sometimes exploits will use tftp
  to download executables and stuff, so maybe. (windows) 

RCP protocol:

  i doubt anyone actually uses this. maybe in rare exploit situations on
  windows.


pcap fixing
-----------

I'm not sure what could be done to improve this, except more robust parsing
of input, and perhaps verifying output of wireshark from different versions.
